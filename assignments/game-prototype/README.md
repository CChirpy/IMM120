## Description
A tamagotchi web game prototype, made to be played with the [console](https://editor.p5js.org/huangc8/sketches/uT-aUU3lN).

### How to play
- /cat /dog

## Learning Objectives
- Gain experience thinking in terms of object-oriented design
- Gain mastery over the interactions between sprites and user interactions, including via collisions, overlapping, touches, position, etc.
- Learn how to represent multiple “states” of a game, including a title screen, game play, end screen, credits screen, etc.

## Additional Notes
- Invalid input will result in a sound being played
