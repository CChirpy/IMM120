# IMM120
- Introduction to Interactive Computing | Fall 2019
- Class taught by [Professor Fishburn](https://imm.tcnj.edu/people/faculty/josh-fishburn/)

## Course Description
A first course in computing languages for interactive multimedia. Students learn how to “talk” to a computer using programming, in the process creating custom software, visualizations, interactive installations and games. Through intensive laboratory experience, students learn the fundamentals of programming, including data types, algorithms, events, control structures, functions, heuristics, logic, interaction and abstraction. Students also learn to work with a range methods for input and output, including bitmap and vector graphics, sound, animation, video and sensors.

### Unit 2: Interactivity
Key terms: frame, boolean, the logical AND/OR operator (&&/||), key variable, transformations, push, pop, persistence of vision, frame rate, float, sine/cosine

### Unit 3: Abstraction and Modularity
